## Facts

* She is sister of the king in [[75.1325 = A I 12]]

* At the beginning of AAM [[75.2465]], now dated to Yb.16, she is mentioned as sister of the king and [[Tarib-damu, Yiṯġar-Damu's daughter and divine lady|Tarib-damu]] as her (or his?) sister.

* Tinīb-dūrum is mentioned at the beginning of the dam en lists thorough the period during which Tabur-damu became queen (she last appears in D₇ = [[75.1770 = A XX 6]], dated between Yb.14-Y.-Ḏ.3).

* Her investment as divine lady of god ʾHadda-bal of Luban is registered in [[75.2022 [IIIa (4)] = M 10 22 = Archi, in Eblaitica 1 (1987), pp. 117–120]].[^1] Eighteen high ranking officials from Ebla offered silver, garments, and jewels; thirteen among them also offered one or more female servants. Tinīb-dūrum left Ebla with thirteen young girls, eleven sets of  garments, and eighteen pairs of toggle-pins. 75.2022 must thus be contemporary to [[75.1860 = M 10 20]] and [[76.288]] which mention her leave and (esp. M 10 20) are linked to Yibriyum's death. (year 19)

* ~~Once she leaves Ebla for Luban, she is replaced by A-ma-ga who was sister to~~ [[Tarib-damu, Yiṯġar-Damu's daughter and divine lady|Tarib-damu]] like her, as in [[75.2429 = M 12 36]] (Y.-Ḏ. 10):

* This situation is probably explained by the fact that the soon-to-be divine ladies were entrusted with the silver for the face mask of god KUra.
